/**
 * Hot-path caches for the runtime policy stores.
 *
 * `loadRuntimePolicyState` runs once per proxied request, and the proxy is a
 * long-running process while the stores are mutated by separate CLI processes
 * (`account pause`, `budget`, `routing profile`). The naive path re-read +
 * re-parsed three JSON files and re-walked the project-root ancestor chain on
 * every request. These caches keep semantics identical while reducing the
 * steady-state cost to a handful of `statSync` calls:
 *
 * - Store entries are keyed by absolute file path and guarded by an
 *   `mtimeMs:ctimeMs:size` fingerprint (same approach as
 *   `lib/runtime/rotation-storage-meta.ts`): the store is only re-read when
 *   the fingerprint changes. `ctimeMs` is part of the fingerprint because it
 *   cannot be pinned back the way `mtimeMs` can — on POSIX every write bumps
 *   it, and on Windows every rename-replacement produces a new file creation
 *   time — so a rewrite that preserves mtime+size is still caught instead of
 *   being served stale for the TTL. A fingerprint match is additionally only
 *   trusted once the file's own mtime has settled past `MTIME_SETTLE_MS` —
 *   two rapid writes can share a coarse mtime tick on some filesystems (FAT
 *   2s, ~1s Windows/network volumes), so inside the settle window we always
 *   re-read. `STORE_CACHE_TTL_MS` bounds staleness for the pathological case
 *   where a rewrite leaves mtime, ctime and size unchanged, and
 *   `STORE_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` bounds the map (tests rotate through many
 *   per-test `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` temp dirs).
 *
 *   Two failure modes get dedicated handling so they cannot poison the cache:
 *   a file rewritten *while* the loader is reading it is detected by
 *   re-statting after the load and only caching when the fingerprint is
 *   stable across the read (an old parse is never stored under the new
 *   file's fingerprint); and a read that resolves to the empty store while
 *   bytes still exist on disk — exhausted EBUSY/EPERM retries or corrupt
 *   JSON both surface as `emptyStore()` from the loaders — is served but
 *   never cached, so a transient failure cannot hide a real policy for the
 *   full TTL.
 *
 * - Project resolution (`findProjectRoot` + `resolveProjectStorageIdentityRoot`
 *   + `getProjectStorageKey`) is cached per resolved startDir for
 *   `PROJECT_RESOLUTION_TTL_MS` and guarded by two fingerprints: an
 *   mtime/ctime/size fingerprint of the resolved root's `.git` entry — the file
 *   whose contents drive worktree identity resolution — and the joined
 *   fingerprints of every ancestor directory that could host a marker, whose
 *   mtimes change when a marker file is created or deleted. Entries
 *   therefore invalidate when the project context differs (different
 *   startDir key, different resolved root), when the `.git` entry changes,
 *   or when a marker appears/disappears in a watched ancestor — the TTL is
 *   only the residual bound for coarse-mtime filesystems that report no
 *   change at all.
 *
 * Values held in the caches are shared, mutable objects. Callers must treat
 * returned values as read-only; `loadRuntimePolicyState` clones what it hands
 * out.
