# Storage Paths Reference

Canonical and compatibility paths for account, settings, cache, and logs.

---

## Canonical root

Default root: `~/.codex/multi-auth`

Override root: `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR=<path>`

When `CODEX_HOME` is set to a non-default directory, multi-auth resolves
strictly to `$CODEX_HOME/multi-auth` and does not scan `~/.codex/multi-auth`
for existing pools.

### First-run setup marker

`first-run-setup.json` records a one-shot marker on the first manager CLI
invocation after install and best-effort self-heals the packaged app bind +
launcher routing when runtime rotation is enabled. Concurrent first invocations
claim the marker with an exclusive create, so setup runs at most once; failures
are debug-logged and never block the user command.

The marker carries a `version`. A `version: 1` marker (written before the Codex
auth-store step existed) is migrated in place on the next invocation: only that
step is replayed, and app bind / launcher install are deliberately not rerun so
shortcuts the user removed stay removed. The migration takes no exclusive claim
because both the `config.toml` rewrite and the marker write are idempotent and
atomic. An unreadable or truncated marker is treated as pre-v2 and migrated the
same way rather than re-triggering full setup.

A *failed* auth-store step deliberately leaves the marker pre-v2 so the next
invocation retries it — otherwise one transient Windows `EPERM`/`EBUSY` on a
locked `config.toml` would strand the CLI on keychain mode permanently. This
applies to the initial setup too: if that step fails there, the marker records
the older version and the next run replays only that step. A `skipped` result
does advance the version — the normal outcome for a config already pinned to
`"file"` and for an explicit `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0`
opt-out. Deleting the marker can re-trigger first-run setup on the next CLI
run.

### Ownership notes

- `~/.codex/multi-auth/*` is managed by this project; `~/.codex/accounts.json`,
  `~/.codex/auth.json`, and `~/.codex/config.toml` are managed by the official
  Codex CLI.
- The `codex-multi-auth-codex` wrapper preserves the official file-backed auth
  layout by forwarding non-auth commands with
  `-c cli_auth_credentials_store="file"` — unless the caller already set it —
  keeping auth state readable from disk for non-TTY flows.
- The `-c` override only covers processes the wrapper launches. Third-party
  front-ends exec the official binary directly and read `~/.codex/config.toml`,
  so the *persisted* top-level value is reconciled to `"file"` at three points:
  first-run setup, wrapper startup before forwarding, and `doctor --fix`.
- Only the top-level assignment is rewritten: a `cli_auth_credentials_store`
  inside `[profiles.*]` is left as authored, a missing top-level key is
  inserted above the first table, existing line endings are preserved (CRLF
  stays CRLF), and `'file'` is recognized as already-correct.
- `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` opts out of both the `-c`
  injection and the wrapper-startup config reconcile.
  `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` opts out of every
  `config.toml` rewrite (first-run, switch/login sync, `doctor --fix`) while
  leaving the per-invocation `-c` override in place.
- Neither the keychain nor the `security` CLI is ever read or written —
  reading a keychain item would itself raise the prompt this exists to
  eliminate. Credentials saved by an earlier `codex login` stay where they are,
  are no longer read once the store is pinned to `"file"`, and can be removed
  manually via Keychain Access.
- Runtime rotation may create a temporary shadow `CODEX_HOME` under the OS temp
  directory while a forwarded command runs; the wrapper syncs refreshed
  official state files back to the original home before cleanup.
- Interactive TUI sessions are the exception: they run against the canonical
  `CODEX_HOME` with `-c` provider overrides, so session history and SQLite
  state are read/written in place and `config.toml` is never rewritten. Two
  interactive sessions can therefore run concurrently against the same state —
  identical to running the official CLI twice; no lock is taken (covered by a
  regression test in `test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts`).
- V3 account storage may also carry `pinnedAccountIndex` and
  `affinityGeneration` for CLI pin / session-affinity invalidation.

> **Windows note:** the wrapper keeps the official file-store layout unchanged,
> so `EPERM`/`EBUSY` retry handling lives with downstream CLI writes. The
> wrapper-startup `config.toml` reconcile writes through the same atomic rename
> with retries; if it still fails the failure is swallowed because the
> per-invocation `-c` override already protects that run.

### Backup metadata

- `getBackupMetadata()` reports deterministic snapshot lists for the canonical
  account pool (primary, WAL, `.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, discovered manual
  backups) and flagged-account state (same minus WAL). Cache-like artifacts and
  `.reset-intent` markers are excluded from recovery candidates.
- `settings.json.bak` stores the last valid unified settings snapshot and is
  used as a recovery fallback only when `settings.json` exists but cannot be
  read.
- Flagged-account backup recovery is suppressed whenever the flagged reset
  marker survives a partial clear — restore distinguishes unreadable state from
  intentionally cleared state.

Validate restore/clear flows with `codex-multi-auth verify-flagged`,
`codex-multi-auth fix --dry-run`, and `codex-multi-auth doctor --fix`.

## Project-scoped account paths

When project-scoped behavior is enabled:

- `~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`

`<project-key>` = sanitized project folder basename (max 40 chars) + `-` +
first 12 chars of `sha256(normalized project path)`. On Windows, normalization
lowercases drive/path segments before hashing. Implementation:
`lib/storage/paths.ts` (`getProjectStorageKey`).

Worktree behavior:

- Standard repositories: identity is the project root path.
- Linked Git worktrees: identity is the shared repository root — all worktrees
  of one repo share one account pool.
- Non-Git directories: identity falls back to the detected project path.

---

## Legacy compatibility paths

Migration-only, not canonical for new setups:

- `~/DevTools/config/codex/`
- older pre-`~/.codex/multi-auth` custom roots

---

## Runtime rotation paths

Runtime rotation adds local state only when enabled or when a helper recently
ran.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/runtime-observability.json` | Request counters, last selected runtime account metadata, cooldown context for status/report commands (mode 0600) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/runtime-rotation-app-helper.<pid>.json` | Wrapper-launched `codex app` helper state — one file per helper; the un-suffixed legacy name is still read. Terminal stamps persist until a launch or `rotation unbind-app` sweeps dead-PID files |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/runtime-rotation-app-helper-owner.<pid>.json` | Helper owner identity; removed on clean helper exit, swept with the status files |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-bind.json` | Persistent packaged-app bind state |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/codex-config-backup.json` | Backup metadata for restoring the real Codex `config.toml` |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-bind-status.json` | Persistent app router status |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-router.log` | Persistent app router log |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/first-run-setup.json` | One-shot first-CLI-run marker (versioned; v1 migrates in place) |

The app bind writes a provider entry to the real `~/.codex/config.toml` only
after taking a backup. `codex-multi-auth rotation disable` and
`codex-multi-auth rotation unbind-app` restore the backup and remove the router
startup entry. `unbind-app` also sweeps orphaned helper status/owner metadata —
it is the recovery path when helpers accumulate with no new launches — while
preserving, with a warning, records whose PID is still live.

---

## macOS Menu Bar Companion

`codex-multi-auth menubar install` manages two paths under the current user's home:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/Applications/Codex Multi Auth Quota.app` | Locally built and signed native quota app; executable at `Contents/MacOS/CodexMultiAuthQuota` and bundle metadata at `Contents/Info.plist` |
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ndycode.codex-multi-auth-quota.plist` | User login launch registration and executable search path |

The Swift release build is generated under `apps/macos-menubar/.build/` inside
the installed package. Build products are local and excluded from distribution.
`CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` does not relocate the companion app or LaunchAgent, and the
installer does not copy this override into the login agent's environment.

The companion keeps its last quota snapshot in memory and consumes masked labels
from `codex-multi-auth limits --json`; it does not read credential files directly.
Cached reads occur every 60 seconds. Manual refresh uses `limits --json --refresh`
and can update the CLI-owned quota cache under the configured multi-auth root.

`codex-multi-auth menubar uninstall` stops the login agent and removes only the
two managed paths above. It preserves `~/.codex/multi-auth/`, saved accounts,
quota cache, official Codex state under `~/.codex/`, and the official Codex app.
No account-data migration or removal is part of companion installation or removal.

## Local governance and bridge paths

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/` | Local usage ledger directory and rotated archives |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/usage-ledger.jsonl` | Append-only local usage metadata ledger |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/usage-ledger.<timestamp>.jsonl` | Archives produced by `codex-multi-auth usage rotate` |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/account-policies.json` | Hashed-account policy metadata: tags, weights, pause, drain, notes (`codex-multi-auth account ...`) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/routing-profiles.json` | Project-aware profile preferences keyed by `getProjectStorageKey` (file-only; no write command) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/budget-guards.json` | Local budget limits evaluated from usage summaries (`codex-multi-auth budget ...`) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/local-client-tokens.json` | Local bridge token hashes and prefixes only (`codex-multi-auth bridge token ...`) |

The local bridge is loopback-only and exposes `/health`, `/v1/models`, and
`/v1/responses`. Plaintext tokens are shown only by `bridge token create` /
`rotate`; the store persists hashes.

Policy pause/drain entries in `account-policies.json` are enforced at selection
time by `evaluateRuntimePolicy` — blocked accounts are excluded from hybrid
rotation.

---

## Named backup exports

Experimental named backup exports are written under the backup namespace beside
the active accounts file:

- global root: `~/.codex/multi-auth/backups/<name>.json`
- project root: `~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/backups/<name>.json`

Rules:

- `.json` is appended when omitted
- names may only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`
- path separators and `..` are rejected
- `.rotate.`, `.tmp`, and `.wal` names are rejected
- existing files are not overwritten unless a lower-level force path is used
  explicitly

---

## oc-chatgpt target paths

Experimental sync targets the companion `oc-codex-multi-auth` (formerly
`oc-chatgpt-multi-auth`) storage layout, root overridable with
`OC_CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` (the legacy `OC_CHATGPT_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` name is still
accepted as a fallback). Both account filenames are detected — the current
`oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json` and the legacy
`openai-codex-accounts.json` — preferring the current name when a root holds
both:

- global target: `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json`
- project target: `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json`
- legacy equivalents: `openai-codex-accounts.json` in the same locations
- target backups: `~/.opencode/backups/` or project-local `backups/` beside the
  target account file
