### First-run setup marker

`first-run-setup.json` lives under the multi-auth root
(`getCodexMultiAuthDir()` / `~/.codex/multi-auth` by default). On the first
manager CLI invocation after install, the package records a one-shot marker and
best-effort self-heals packaged app bind + launcher routing when runtime
rotation is enabled. Concurrent first invocations claim the marker with an
exclusive create so setup runs at most once. Failures are debug-logged and never
block the user command.

The marker carries a `version`. A marker written before the Codex auth-store
step existed (`version: 1`) is migrated in place on the next manager CLI
invocation: only that step is replayed, and app bind / launcher install are
deliberately not rerun so shortcuts the user removed stay removed. The migration
takes no exclusive claim because both the `config.toml` rewrite and the marker
write are idempotent and atomic. An unreadable or truncated marker is treated as
pre-v2 and migrated the same way, rather than re-triggering full setup.

A *failed* auth-store step deliberately leaves the marker pre-v2 so the next
invocation retries it — otherwise one transient Windows `EPERM`/`EBUSY` on a
locked `config.toml` would strand the CLI on keychain mode permanently. This
applies to the initial setup too: if that step fails there, the marker records
the older version and the next run replays only that step. A `skipped` result
does advance the version, since it is the normal outcome both for a config
already pinned to `"file"` and for an explicit
`CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` opt-out.

Deleting the marker can re-trigger first-run setup on
the next CLI run.

Ownership note:

- `~/.codex/multi-auth/*` is managed by this project.
- `~/.codex/accounts.json`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, and `~/.codex/config.toml` are managed by official Codex CLI.
- The `codex-multi-auth-codex` wrapper preserves that official CLI file-backed auth layout by forwarding non-auth commands with `-c cli_auth_credentials_store="file"`, unless the caller already set `cli_auth_credentials_store` explicitly.
- That `-c` override only covers processes the wrapper launches. Third-party front-ends (menu-bar apps such as CodexBar, editor extensions) exec the official binary directly and read `~/.codex/config.toml` instead, so a config left on `cli_auth_credentials_store = "keychain"` keeps raising macOS login-keychain "Always Allow" prompts. The *persisted* top-level value is therefore reconciled to `"file"` at three points: first-run setup, wrapper startup before forwarding, and `doctor --fix`.
- Only the top-level assignment is rewritten. A `cli_auth_credentials_store` inside a `[profiles.*]` table is left as authored, and a top-level key is inserted above the first table instead. The rewrite preserves the file's existing line endings (a CRLF `config.toml` stays CRLF) and accepts either TOML string form, so `'file'` is recognized as already-correct and left alone.
- Set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` to opt out of both the wrapper-injected `-c` override and the wrapper-startup config reconcile, leaving the downstream CLI auth store untouched.
- Set `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` to opt out of every `config.toml` rewrite (first-run, account switch/login sync, and `doctor --fix`) while leaving the per-invocation `-c` override in place.
- Neither the keychain nor the `security` CLI is ever read or written: reading a keychain item would itself raise the prompt this behavior exists to eliminate. Credentials saved by an earlier official `codex login` stay where they are, are no longer read once the store is pinned to `"file"`, and can be removed manually via Keychain Access.
- Runtime rotation may create a temporary shadow `CODEX_HOME` under the operating-system temp directory while a forwarded Codex command is running. The wrapper syncs refreshed official state files back to the original Codex home before cleanup.
- Interactive TUI sessions are the exception: they run against the canonical `CODEX_HOME` and receive the rotation provider through `-c` overrides instead, so session history and SQLite state are read and written in place rather than copied into a shadow and synced back. `config.toml` itself is never rewritten on this path.
- Because interactive sessions share the canonical home, two of them can run concurrently against the same state — the same as running the official CLI twice. No lock is taken: neither session copies or syncs state, so there is nothing to clobber, and serializing them would be a regression against stock behavior. Concurrent-session state retention is covered by a regression test in `test/codex-bin-wrapper.test.ts`.
- When `CODEX_HOME` is set to a non-default directory, multi-auth resolves strictly to `$CODEX_HOME/multi-auth` and does not scan `~/.codex/multi-auth` for existing pools.
- V3 account storage may also carry `pinnedAccountIndex` and `affinityGeneration` for CLI pin / session-affinity invalidation.

Compatibility note:

- This file-store forwarding keeps auth state readable from disk outside interactive terminals, so wrapper forwarding and non-TTY auth flows stay deterministic after the Ink migration.

> **Windows note:** The wrapper keeps the official Codex CLI file-store layout unchanged, so Windows `EPERM`/`EBUSY` retry handling still lives with the downstream CLI writes rather than this wrapper layer. Opting out with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0` stops injecting the file-store override for future wrapper launches, but it does not rewrite or expose previously written CLI auth files beyond the standard `~/.codex/auth.json` and `~/.codex/accounts.json` locations. The wrapper-startup `config.toml` reconcile writes through the same atomic rename with `EPERM`/`EBUSY` retries; if it still fails (locked or read-only config), the failure is swallowed and forwarding proceeds, because the per-invocation `-c` override already protects that run.

Backup metadata:

- `getBackupMetadata()` reports deterministic snapshot lists for the canonical account pool (primary, WAL, `.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, and discovered manual backups) and flagged-account state (primary, `.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, and discovered manual backups). Cache-like artifacts and `.reset-intent` markers are excluded from recovery candidates.
- `settings.json.bak` stores the last valid unified settings snapshot before each write and is used as a recovery fallback when `settings.json` is unreadable.
- Flagged-account backup recovery is suppressed whenever the flagged reset marker is still present, so partial clears cannot revive previously cleared flagged entries.

Upgrade note:

- Restore workflows now distinguish between unreadable state and intentionally cleared state. `settings.json.bak` is only used when `settings.json` exists but cannot be read, while flagged-account backups stay suppressed whenever the reset marker survives a partial clear.
- Operators validating a restore or clear flow should use `codex-multi-auth verify-flagged`, `codex-multi-auth fix --dry-run`, and `codex-multi-auth doctor --fix` to confirm what will be recovered, what stays cleared, and whether manual repair is still needed.
- Maintainers validating the on-disk upgrade behavior can run `npm run build` plus `npm test -- --run test/unified-settings.test.ts test/storage-recovery-paths.test.ts test/storage-flagged.test.ts` before shipping backup or restore changes.

## Project-Scoped Account Paths

When project-scoped behavior is enabled:

- `~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`

`<project-key>` is derived as:

- sanitized project folder basename (max 40 chars)
- `-`
- first 12 chars of `sha256(normalized project path)`

On Windows, normalization lowercases drive/path segments before hashing.
Implementation reference: `lib/storage/paths.ts` (`getProjectStorageKey`).

**Worktree behavior:**

- Standard repositories: identity is the project root path.
- Linked Git worktrees: identity is the shared repository root, so all worktrees for the same repo share one account pool.
- Non-Git directories: identity falls back to the detected project path.

---

## Legacy Compatibility Paths

Older installations may still have compatibility-read paths during migration. These are migration-only and not canonical for new setup.

Examples:

- `~/DevTools/config/codex/`
- older pre-`~/.codex/multi-auth` custom roots

---

## Runtime Rotation Paths

Runtime rotation adds local state only when enabled or when a helper has recently run.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/runtime-observability.json` | request counters, last selected runtime account metadata, and cooldown context for status/report commands |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/runtime-rotation-app-helper.<pid>.json` | wrapper-launched `codex app` helper state, idle timeout, request count, and last-account metadata — one file per helper; the un-suffixed name is the legacy shared path from older versions, still read. A terminal stamp persists until the next helper launch sweeps files whose PID is dead; the owner file is removed on clean helper exit. `codex-multi-auth rotation unbind-app` sweeps the same metadata independently — including owner files with no surviving status record — so it is the recovery path when helpers have accumulated and nothing is launching new ones. It preserves, with a warning, any record whose PID is still live |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-bind.json` | persistent packaged-app bind state |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/codex-config-backup.json` | backup metadata for restoring the real Codex `config.toml` |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-bind-status.json` | persistent app router status |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/app-bind/runtime-rotation-app-router.log` | persistent app router log |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/first-run-setup.json` | one-shot first CLI run marker for Codex auth-store enforcement / app bind / launcher self-heal (versioned; v1 markers migrate in place) |

The app bind writes a provider entry to the real `~/.codex/config.toml` only after taking a backup. `codex-multi-auth rotation disable` and `codex-multi-auth rotation unbind-app` restore the backup and remove the router startup entry.

---

## macOS Menu Bar Companion

`codex-multi-auth menubar install` manages two paths under the current user's home:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/Applications/Codex Multi Auth Quota.app` | Locally built and signed native quota app; executable at `Contents/MacOS/CodexMultiAuthQuota` and bundle metadata at `Contents/Info.plist` |
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ndycode.codex-multi-auth-quota.plist` | User login launch registration and executable search path |

The Swift release build is generated under `apps/macos-menubar/.build/` inside
the installed package. Build products are local and excluded from distribution.
`CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` does not relocate the companion app or LaunchAgent, and the
installer does not copy this override into the login agent's environment.

The companion keeps its last quota snapshot in memory and consumes masked labels
from `codex-multi-auth limits --json`; it does not read credential files directly.
Cached reads occur every 60 seconds. Manual refresh uses `limits --json --refresh`
and can update the CLI-owned quota cache under the configured multi-auth root.

`codex-multi-auth menubar uninstall` stops the login agent and removes only the
two managed paths above. It preserves `~/.codex/multi-auth/`, saved accounts,
quota cache, official Codex state under `~/.codex/`, and the official Codex app.
No account-data migration or removal is part of companion installation or removal.

## Local Governance and Bridge Paths

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/` | Directory for the local usage ledger and rotated archives |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/usage-ledger.jsonl` | Append-only local usage metadata ledger |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/usage/usage-ledger.<timestamp>.jsonl` | Archived ledgers produced by `codex-multi-auth usage rotate` |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/account-policies.json` | Hashed-account policy metadata for tags, weights, pause, drain, and notes (`codex-multi-auth account ...`) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/routing-profiles.json` | Project-aware profile preferences keyed with `getProjectStorageKey` |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/budget-guards.json` | Local budget limits evaluated from usage summaries (`codex-multi-auth budget ...`) |
| `~/.codex/multi-auth/local-client-tokens.json` | Local bridge token hashes and prefixes only (`codex-multi-auth bridge token ...`) |

The local bridge is loopback-only and exposes `/health`, `/v1/models`, and
`/v1/responses`. Plain client tokens are shown only by `codex-multi-auth bridge token
create` or `codex-multi-auth bridge token rotate`; the token store persists hashes.

Policy pause/drain entries in `account-policies.json` are enforced at selection
time by `evaluateRuntimePolicy` (blocked accounts are excluded from hybrid
rotation).

## Named Backup Exports

Experimental named backup exports are written under the local plugin-owned backup namespace beside the active accounts file:

- global root: `~/.codex/multi-auth/backups/<name>.json`
- project root: `~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/backups/<name>.json`

Rules:

- `.json` is appended when omitted
- backup names may only contain letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`
- path separators and `..` are rejected
- `.rotate.`, `.tmp`, and `.wal` names are rejected
- existing files are not overwritten unless a lower-level force path is used explicitly

---

## oc-chatgpt Target Paths

Experimental sync targets the companion `oc-chatgpt-multi-auth` storage layout:

- global target: `~/.opencode/openai-codex-accounts.json`
- project target: `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`
- target backups: `~/.opencode/backups/` or project-local `backups/` beside the target account file
