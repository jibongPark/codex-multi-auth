# codex-multi-auth Architecture

How `codex-multi-auth` fits around the official Codex CLI: which binaries exist, what each one does, how a forwarded request travels through the loopback rotation proxy to a managed account, and where state lives.

For the maintainer-level module map, see [development/ARCHITECTURE.md](development/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## The Short Version

`codex-multi-auth` is a multi-account OAuth manager for the official `@openai/codex` CLI. It keeps a pool of ChatGPT-backed Codex accounts on disk, picks the healthiest one for each request, and keeps the official CLI in charge of everything else.

- `codex-multi-auth ...` runs the local account manager (login, switch, health, repair, governance).
- `codex-multi-auth-codex ...` is the opt-in forwarding wrapper: `auth ...` commands stay local, everything else is forwarded to the official Codex CLI with runtime rotation applied.
- `mcodex ...` is a convenience launcher over that same wrapper.
- The package does **not** publish a global `codex` binary; that name stays owned by the official Codex install.
- Runtime rotation is **default-on**: request-bearing sessions launched through the wrapper (or the packaged-app bind) send Responses traffic through a localhost-only proxy that selects a managed account per request.
- All state — accounts, settings, quota cache, usage ledger, policies, backups — lives under `~/.codex/multi-auth`. Official Codex state stays under `~/.codex`.

## Published Binaries

`package.json` publishes four bins:

| Binary | Script | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `codex-multi-auth` | `scripts/codex-multi-auth.js` | Account manager only. Bare subcommands normalize to `auth` subcommands, so `codex-multi-auth status` and `codex-multi-auth auth status` are the same call. |
| `codex-multi-auth-codex` | `scripts/codex.js` | Wrapper/forwarder. `auth ...` runs locally; every other command resolves the real official Codex binary and forwards to it, with runtime rotation wired in when enabled. |
| `mcodex` | `scripts/mcodex.js` | Convenience launcher. Forwards to `codex.js`; adds `--monitor` (watch `codex-multi-auth list`) and `--tmux` / `-t` session helpers. Contains no account logic. |
| `codex-multi-auth-app-launcher` | `scripts/codex-app-launcher.js` | OS-level launcher routing: retargets supported user-level shortcuts or installs a managed wrapper app. |

A fifth shipped script, `scripts/codex-app-router.js`, is the persistent localhost router used by the packaged-app bind — it is spawned, not a bin.

## The Request Path, End to End

The default rotation path for a forwarded request-bearing command (for example `codex-multi-auth-codex exec "…"`):

```text
You
 |
 | codex-multi-auth-codex exec "..."      (or mcodex, or the bound Codex app)
 v
scripts/codex.js  ─── auth ...? ──yes──> local account manager (lib/codex-manager.ts)
 |
 | no: resolve official Codex binary
 | build shadow CODEX_HOME (or canonical home + -c overrides for TUI/resume/app-server)
 | model_provider = "codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy", base_url = http://127.0.0.1:<port>
 | inject per-launch client key via OPENAI_API_KEY
 v
Official Codex CLI ──POST /responses──>
 |
 v
Runtime rotation proxy (loopback only)
 |
 | 1. authenticate client (per-launch key, timing-safe compare)
 | 2. gate method/path/body (Responses, models, images, thread-goal only)
 | 3. evaluateRuntimePolicy: model allow/deny, budgets, pause/drain, tags
 | 4. choose account: pin → priority → sequential|affinity → hybrid → scan
 | 5. refresh access token if inside the 60s skew window
 | 6. forward upstream (redirects never followed)
 | 7. on retryable failure mark + rotate to next eligible account
 v
https://chatgpt.com/backend-api (official upstream)
 |
 | stream back: strip hop-by-hop + private headers, scan usage, record ledger row
 v
Your terminal
```

Details worth knowing:

- **Loopback only.** The proxy refuses non-loopback binds and authenticates every request with a random per-launch key. Your account tokens are injected upstream; they never appear in client-facing responses.
- **Auth before routing.** An unauthenticated request gets `401 runtime_rotation_proxy_unauthorized` before the path is even inspected.
- **Redirects are never followed** (`redirect: "error"`), so a Bearer token cannot be exfiltrated to a redirected host.
- **Failure is never a silent hang.** Transient failures rotate to another account; true exhaustion returns `503 codex_runtime_rotation_pool_exhausted` with per-account skip reasons and `retry_after_ms`, and points at `codex-multi-auth rotation status`.
- **Two homes.** Non-interactive commands get a throwaway shadow `CODEX_HOME` (state synced back on exit). Interactive TUI, `resume`/`fork`, and `app-server` run against the canonical `CODEX_HOME` with the provider injected as `-c` overrides, so session history is not copied and reindexed on every launch. `codex app` also gets a shadow home through the app-helper context unless `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_APP_ROTATION_USE_CANONICAL_HOME=1`.
- **Opt-out.** `codex-multi-auth rotation disable` or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_RUNTIME_ROTATION_PROXY=0` returns to plain forwarding.

### Account selection, in one breath

Per request the proxy tries, in order: a soft pin left by `codex-multi-auth switch`, policy priority tiers (lower `account priority` numbers first), a hard pin from `--account`/`CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT`, the sequential stick-until-exhausted cursor, session affinity (20-minute sticky sessions), a hybrid score (`health*2 + tokens*5 + hoursSinceUsed*2 + capability boost`), and finally a linear scan. An account is skipped when it is disabled, workspace-disabled, token-invalid, rate-limited, cooling down, or has an open circuit breaker.

## Components

### 1. Account manager

`codex-multi-auth <command>` dispatches to `lib/codex-manager.ts` + `lib/codex-manager/commands/`:

| Area | Commands |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | `login`, `list`, `status`, `switch <index>`, `unpin`, `workspace` |
| Health / selection | `check`, `forecast`, `best`, `report`, `why-selected` |
| Repair | `fix`, `doctor`, `verify`, `verify-flagged` |
| Rotation | `rotation status\|enable\|disable\|bind-app\|unbind-app\|reset-runtime` |
| Governance | `usage`, `budget`, `account` (tag/weight/priority/pause/drain/note), `models`, `monitor` |
| Bridge / integrations | `bridge token …`, `integrations` |
| Sessions / config | `history`, `config explain`, `init-config`, `debug bundle`, `uninstall` |

On an interactive terminal with a populated pool, bare `codex-multi-auth login` opens the dashboard instead of a bare sign-in; `--device-auth` covers headless/remote logins, and `--manual`/`--no-browser` prints a paste-back flow. The OAuth callback server binds port `1455` on both `::1` and `127.0.0.1` — the registered redirect URI is fixed, so a conflict on either family is fatal rather than silently degraded.

### 2. Wrapper and shadow `CODEX_HOME`

`codex-multi-auth-codex` resolves the real official Codex binary (env override → installed package → global npm root → `PATH`), then:

- reconciles `cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"` in `~/.codex/config.toml` so forwarded sessions use file-backed auth (opt out with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_ENFORCE_CLI_FILE_AUTH_STORE=0`),
- resolves an ephemeral `--account <index|email|id>` / `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_FORCE_ACCOUNT` pin (never mutates the persisted `switch` pin),
- starts the loopback rotation proxy and points the Codex provider config at it,
- spawns official Codex (with bounded retries and an unsupported-model fallback chain), and
- syncs refreshed official state back out of the shadow home on exit.

### 3. Runtime rotation proxy

`lib/runtime-rotation-proxy.ts`, provider id `codex-multi-auth-runtime-proxy`. It forwards only these routes: `POST /responses` (+ `/codex/`, `/v1/` aliases), `GET /models` (+ `/v1`), [image generation/edit routes](reference/image-routes.md), and `GET|POST /thread/goal/*`. Everything else is a 404. Bodies are capped at 64 MiB; gzip/deflate/br/zstd request encodings are decoded.

Per request it applies policy before picking an account, refreshes tokens through a deduplicating queue (one in-flight refresh per token, cross-process leases so two CLIs do not double-refresh), classifies upstream responses into rotation marks (rate-limit, cooldown, circuit breaker, workspace disable, token invalidation), and streams successful bytes back with stall detection and backpressure. Runtime counters land in `runtime-observability.json` for `status`, `report`, `monitor`, `rotation status`, and `why-selected`.

### 4. Local governance

File-backed, local-only, and enforced on the rotation path by `evaluateRuntimePolicy` (`lib/policy/runtime-policy.ts`):

| Concern | Storage under `~/.codex/multi-auth` | CLI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Usage ledger | `usage/usage-ledger.jsonl` (+ rotated archives) | `codex-multi-auth usage` |
| Budget guards | `budget-guards.json` | `codex-multi-auth budget` |
| Account policy (tags, weight, priority, pause/drain, notes) | `account-policies.json` | `codex-multi-auth account …` |
| Routing profiles (per-project allow/deny, tag weights, budget key) | `routing-profiles.json` | file-only writes; `monitor` reads |
| Quota snapshots | `quota-cache.json` | `limits`, `check`, `forecast --live`, `report` |
| Operator view | runtime observability + all of the above | `codex-multi-auth monitor` |

Budgets are **advisory**: evaluations read a pre-request ledger snapshot, so racing requests can briefly overshoot a limit. Ledger rows are redacted — hashed account identity and request metadata, never prompts or credentials.

### 5. Local bridge (optional)

`lib/local-bridge.ts` exposes a loopback-only OpenAI-compatible surface (`/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/responses`) that forwards to a runtime proxy base URL. Client tokens are `cma_local_*` values; only SHA-256 hashes and prefixes are stored in `local-client-tokens.json`, and the plaintext is shown once at `codex-multi-auth bridge token create|rotate`.

### 6. Storage and project pools

Account storage uses the V3 format (`AccountStorageV3`) under the multi-auth root:

- Global pool: `~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-accounts.json`
- Per-project pools: `~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`, keyed by repo identity root so linked Git worktrees share one pool
- Durability: write-ahead journal (`.wal`), temp-file-then-rename writes `0600`, and a throttled `.bak`/`.bak.1`/`.bak.2` rotation, plus named backups under `backups/`
- Recovery: flagged-account sidecar (`openai-codex-flagged-accounts.json`), pending-auth journal, and `verify`/`fix`/`doctor` repair commands

The active selection is mirrored into the official `~/.codex/auth.json` / `accounts.json` so plain forwarded Codex commands keep the intended account.

### 7. Reversible packaged-app bind

`codex-multi-auth rotation bind-app` backs up the real `~/.codex/config.toml`, points the packaged Codex desktop app at a persistent localhost router (`scripts/codex-app-router.js`), and installs a user-level startup entry. `rotation unbind-app` / `rotation disable` restores the backup. Official app binaries are never patched.

### 8. Lazy first-run setup

`npm` postinstall is notice-only. On the first `codex-multi-auth` invocation from a durable global install, `lib/runtime/first-run.ts` claims `first-run-setup.json` once and runs three best-effort steps: app bind, launcher install, and the `cli_auth_credentials_store` pin. Skipped under CI, `npx`, and project-local installs; failures never block the command.

### 9. Plugin-host entry (compatibility)

The package root still exports a plugin-host runtime (`index.ts`) for hosts that load plugins: it reuses the same pool, refresh queue, request transformer, and policy evaluation. Normal `codex-multi-auth ...` use does not require it.

---

## Design Constraints

- The official OAuth flow remains the source of authentication; the callback port stays `1455`.
- The canonical command family is `codex-multi-auth ...`; no global `codex` bin is published.
- Runtime rotation is default-on, loopback-only, and authenticated with a per-launch client key.
- Proxied Responses requests are forced to `stream: true` and `store: false` (stateless compatibility), with `reasoning.encrypted_content` included, unless background-response compatibility is explicitly enabled.
- Credentials and governance state stay local under `~/.codex/multi-auth`.
- The desktop app bind is reversible and does not patch official app files.
- Default general model routing uses `gpt-6.1-sol`; diagnostic live/quota probes lead with `gpt-5.6-sol`.
